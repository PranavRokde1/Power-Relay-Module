## üß† Features

- **Opto-isolated Input (EL814S)**  
  Ensures electrical separation between control and load circuits.

- **Power Isolation**  
  Electrical isolation between logic-side and relay power, improving safety and protecting microcontrollers.

- **Relay Driver Circuit**  
  Includes BC847B transistor and M7 flyback diode for reliable relay control.

- **Logic Level Select**  
  Configurable jumper allows triggering on HIGH or LOW logic.

- **Visual Status Indicator**  
  Onboard LED indicates relay ON/OFF state.

- **Header Interfaces**  
  Includes VCC, GND, and DIN pins for easy integration.

## üíª Sample Code (Arduino)

```cpp
#define POWER_RELAY_PIN  7  // Define the relay pin

bool Level_Select = true;  // Set to true for Active HIGH, false for Active LOW

void setup() {
  pinMode(POWER_RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);  // Set the relay pin as output
}

void loop() {
  if (Level_Select) {
    // Active HIGH relay mode: HIGH turns the relay ON
    digitalWrite(POWER_RELAY_PIN, HIGH);  
    delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
  
    digitalWrite(POWER_RELAY_PIN, LOW);  // LOW turns the relay OFF
    delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
  } else {
    // Active LOW relay mode: LOW turns the relay ON
    digitalWrite(POWER_RELAY_PIN, LOW);  
    delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
  
    digitalWrite(POWER_RELAY_PIN, HIGH);  // HIGH turns the relay OFF
    delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
  }
}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Always verify relay specs against your target load.
- Use proper insulation/enclosure when working with AC mains.
- Use a regulated 12V supply.
- Mind jumper setting (HIGH or LOW trigger).
